🌟 AI-Powered Kids Story & Poem Generator 📖✨

📌 Overview
This project is an interactive AI-powered application that generates short stories or poems for kids based on a chosen theme. The application uses GPT-4o (via the OpenAI API) to generate text and DALL-E to create visually appealing images that complement the story.

🎯 Features

✅ User Input – Choose a theme/topic (e.g., "a magical forest," "an adventure on the moon").

✅ Optional Customization – Specify an element for the image (e.g., boy, girl, school, park).

✅ AI-Generated Story/Poem – Uses OpenAI's GPT-4o to generate a fun, age-appropriate narrative.

✅ AI-Generated Image – Uses DALL-E to create an illustration matching the story.

✅ Streamlit Integration (Enhanced Version) – Interactive UI for input and output display.

✅ PDF Generation (Enhanced Version) – Exports the generated story/poem along with the image into a PDF.

2️⃣ (Optional) The user specifies an element they want in the image.

3️⃣ The application constructs a prompt and sends a request to OpenAI’s GPT-4o.

4️⃣ The generated story/poem is displayed in the console/UI.

5️⃣ A descriptive image prompt is sent to DALL-E, which returns an AI-generated illustration.

6️⃣ The image is displayed in the application.

7️⃣  The user can download a PDF containing the story and image.
